CLASSNAME: Fighter;
DESCRIPTION: The fighter is the ultimate fighting machine, able to wield all but those
 most exotic of weapons and armor. Their prowess in combat is unmatched and their wide
 selection of feats enables them to {\b {\cf1 train in many fighting styles}}: the classic "sword
 and shield" style, the crushing assault of great axes or a style relying on finesse
 and a pair of fine swords.\par\par
Primary role in a party is the {\b {\cf1 front-line combatant}}, also well-suited to solo play\par
{\b {\cf1 Gains combat feats faster than any other class}}\par
Proficient with {\b {\cf1 all simple and martial weapons}}\par
Can wear {\b {\cf1 all armor and shields}}, including tower shields\par
Cannot inherently cast spells or use wands\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Recommended Attributes: Strength, Constitution}}\par\par
Wherever there is conflict, there are fighters: armed and armored men and women trained
 in combat, to serve as mercenaries, soldiers, guardians or adventurers. Some are kind,
 some are cruel, but all are brave and bold warriors. The fighter studies his opponents'
 weaknesses, develops powerful maneuvers and holds back the encroaching hordes with skill
 and courage.;

CLASSNAME: Paladin;
DESCRIPTION: The paladin is a virtuous combination of fighter and cleric. They possess
 the fighter's combat ability and at higher levels, also gain the ability to cast
 divine spells and turn undead as a cleric. Their unique abilities include {\b {\cf1 special
 auras}} that protect allies and the power to {\b {\cf1 smite evil}} foes.\par\par
Excellent in solo play, especially against evil and undead foes\par
A good secondary front-line combatant (along with fighters and barbarians)\par
Proficient with all simple and martial weapons\par
Can wear all armor and shields, except tower shields\par
Can {\b {\cf1 cast divine spells}} at level 4\par
Can {\b {\cf1 turn undead}} at level 3\par
{\b {\cf1 Immune to disease}} at level 2\par
{\b {\cf1 Must be lawful good}}\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Recommended Attributes: Charisma, Strength, Wisdom, Constitution}}\par\par
The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil -
 these are the three weapons of the paladin. Few possess the piety and devotion that
 it takes to walk the paladin's path, but those few are rewarded with the power to
 protect, to heal, and to smite evil. In a land of evil deeds, unholy cults, backstabbing
 guilds and inscrutable dragons, the paladin is the last, best hope for the forces of Light.;

From the Shadow Marches to the Eldeen Reaches come brave, even reckless warriors.
 Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem,
 impiety, and atrocities. These barbarians, however, have proven their mettle and
 their value to those who would be their allies. To enemies who underestimated them,
 they have proved their cunning and resourcefulness.;

The only thing rogues have in common with one another is that they're all different.
 Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are
 scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they do share is versatility,
 adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what
 others don't want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage
 past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, or the trust of a guard.;

 and the darkest caves of the underworld. Skilled in woodcraft as well as combat, he
 spends years studying the habits of his prey in order to defeat it.;

CLASSNAME: Wizard;
DESCRIPTION: The wizard is the versatile arcane spell-caster. Her high intelligence
 score enables her to learn many spells (and potentially, every spell!) but unlike
 the sorcerer, she must prepare spells in advance. A wizard can also serve as a
 {\b {\cf1 healer for warforged}} allies.\par\par
Lack of armor and combat training makes the sorcerer difficult for solo play\par
Can {\b {\cf1 inscribe spells into their spell books from scrolls}}\par
High intelligence score gives the wizard the ability to learn many skills\par
Have a wider variety of spells, both offensive, defensive and utilitarian than the sorcerer\par
Can learn meta-magic feats and enhancements that bolster her arcane spells\par
Can {\b {\cf1 summon creatures}} to fight for them\par
Proficient with some simple weapons\par
{\b {\cf1 No armor proficiencies}}\par
No alignment restriction\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Recommended Attributes: Intelligence}}\par\par
A few muttered words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe when
 they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy,
 but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend to learn her craft. Unlike
 sorcerers, wizards depend on intensive study to create their magic. They research
 musty old tomes, debate magical theory with their peers, and practice minor magics
 whenever they can.;

CLASSNAME: Sorcerer;
DESCRIPTION: The sorcerer is the most powerful of the ranged attackers. While capable
 of casting spells quickly and possessing more spell points than wizards, the
 sorcerer also prepares fewer spells than their arcane counterparts. A sorcerer can
 also {\b {\cf1 repair warforged}} characters using magic.\par\par
Lack of armor and combat training makes the sorcerer difficult for solo play\par
Sorcerers have the {\b {\cf1 most powerful offensive spells}}\par
Capable of readying {\b {\cf1 fewer spells than the Wizard}}, but able to cast them {\b {\cf1 more
 frequently}}\par
Innate magic enables them to cast spells without memorizing them in advance\par
Can learn meta-magic feats and enhancements that bolster her arcane spells\par
Can {\b {\cf1 summon creatures}} to fight for them\par
Proficient with all simple weapons\par
{\b {\cf1 No armor proficiencies}}\par
High charisma score gives them an edge when dealing with NPCs using skills such as
 diplomacy, bluff, haggle or intimidation\par
No alignment restriction\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Recommended Attributes: Charisma}}\par\par
Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by
 practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories - just raw power that they
 direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons course through their
 veins. Sorcerers often have very good looks, usually with a touch of the exotic,
 that hints at an unusual heritage.;

 be it combat, scouting, or spell-casting. With the ability to {\b {\cf1 heal, enhance and

It is said that music is a kind of magic and the bard proves that saying true.
 Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with her
 music and living off the gratitude of her audience - such is the life of the bard.
 When chance or opportunity draws them into conflict, bards serve as diplomats,
 negotiators, messengers, scouts and spies.;

CLASSNAME: Favored Soul;
DESCRIPTION: Wielding divine magic to both heal and destroy, Favored Souls have fewer spell points than clerics but can cast more often.\par\par
{\b {\cf5 Solo Ability}}: Good.\par\par
With thier innate connection to the divine, favored souls can cast {\b {\cf5 divine}} spells without needing time for study and prayer like clerics, 
 but they can only perform a fixed number of spells in this way.\par\par
Like clerics, favored souls have access to powerful healing spells. Favored souls and sorcerers get more {\b {\cf5 spell points}} than any of the other classes.
 They also gain more bonus spell points from special magical items. As a result, they can cast more often.\par\par
Favored souls cannot switch spells at taverns or rest shrines. They are able to switch spells but to do so they must undergo a speical ritual that can only be 
 done once every few days.\par\par
Charisma is the most important stat for favored souls. High charisma grants the favored soul access to higher level spells and gives him or her more
 {\b {\cf5 spell points}}.\par\par
Wisdom is also important for favored souls, especially those who want to use offensive spells, because wisdom determines how difficult a favored soul's spells are
 for enemies to resist.\par\par
Typical abilities: {\b {\cf5 Empower Spell}}, {\b {\cf5 Leap of Faith}}.;
