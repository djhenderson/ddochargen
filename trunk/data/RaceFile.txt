RACENAME: Human;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 1 bonus feat at first level:}}
 Humans are quick to master specialized tasks and are varied in their talents.\par
{\b {\cf1 4 extra skill points at first level and 1 extra skill point at each additional level:}}
 Humans are versatile and capable.\par\par
Humans are the most adaptable and flexible of the common races. They are diverse in their
 morals, customs, and habits. Hardy or fine, light-skinned or dark, showy or austere, devout or
 impious, humans run the gamut.\par\par
Human adventurers are the most audacious, daring, and ambitious members of an audacious, daring,
 and ambitious race. A human can earn glory in the eyes of his fellows by amassing power, wealth,
 and fame. Humans, more than other people, champion causes rather than territories, factions,
 or groups.\par\par
Humans, although relatively young in comparison to most other races, dominate Eberron. Human culture
 was born on the distant continent of Sarlona, with the first settlers sailing from Sarlona's western
 coast to the region of Khorvaire now called the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they spread across
 continent of Kharvaire, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving ruined goblin
 kingdoms in their wake. Today, human contact has extended over most of the world, recently reaching
 the distant continent of Xen'drik. Humans are affiliated with the House Deneith in Stormreach.;

RACENAME: Elf;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 +2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution:}}
 Elves are graceful but frail, and are better at stealth and archery.\par
{\b {\cf1 Immune to magic sleep effects and +2 saving throw bonus against Enchantment spells:}}
 Elves do not sleep, but rest while meditating in a deep trance.\par
{\b {\cf1 +2 bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot checks:}}
 An Elf's senses are extremely sensitive.\par
{\b {\cf1 Bonus Martial Weapon Proficiency Feats:}}
 Elves are proficient with the longsword, rapier, longbow, and shortsword.\par\par
Elves are well known for their poetry, dance, song, lore, and magical arts. Elves favor things of
 nature and simple beauty. When danger threatens their woodland homes, however, elves reveal a more
 martial side, demonstrating their skill with sword, bow and battle strategy.\par\par
Elves mingle freely in human lands, always welcome yet never at home there. Life among humans moves
 at a pace that elves dislike: regimented from day to day but changing from decade to decade. Elves
 among humans, therefore, find careers that allow them to wander freely and set their own pace.
 Elves also enjoy demonstrating their prowess with the sword and bow, and they enjoy gaining greater
 magical powers. Adventuring allows them to improve their skill in both.\par\par
The elves of Eberron were born on the mysterious southern continent of Xen'drik, where they were
 slaves of the giant kingdoms. Tens of thousands of years ago, elf slaves rebelled against their masters
 and eventually left Xen'drik entirely. They settled in the fertile tropical rain forest of Aerenal,
 a large island-continent to the southeast of Khorvaire. After the Last War came to an end, elven
 explorers joined in the rediscovery of Xen'drik. Elves are affiliated with the House Phiarlan
 in Stormreach.;

RACENAME: Halfling;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 +2 Dexterity, -2 Strength:}}
 Halflings are quick, agile, and good with ranged weapons, but not as strong as other humanoids.\par
{\b {\cf1 +1 Armor Class bonus, +1 attack roll bonus, +4 bonus on Hide checks, and 3/4 carrying limit:}}
 As Small creatures, Halflings are harder to hit and hide better, but can carry less than the other races.\par
{\b {\cf1 +2 bonus on Jump, Listen, and Move Silently checks:}}
 Halflings are surefooted and nimble.\par
{\b {\cf1 +1 bonus on all saving throws and +2 saving throw bonus against Fear:}}
 Halflings are surprisingly capable at avoiding mishaps.\par
{\b {\cf1 +1 attack roll bonus with thrown weapons:}}
 Throwing stones is a universal sport among Halflings and they have excellent aim.\par\par
Halflings are clever, capable opportunists. Depending on the clan, halflings might be reliable, hard-working
 citizens, or they might be thieves just waiting for the opportunity to make a big score and disappear in the
 dead of night.\par\par
Halfling adventurers are typically looking for a way to use their skills to gain wealth or status. The distinction
 between a halfling adventurer and a halfling just out to make a big score can be blurry. While halfling
 opportunism can sometimes look like larceny or fraud to others, a halfling adventurer who learns to trust
 her fellows is worthy of trust in return.\par\par
In the world of Eberron, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide Talenta Plains. The
 heritage of the nomad also serves more urbanized halflings well, and halflings have established themselves
 across Eberron as merchants, politicians, barristers, healers, and criminals. The tribal nomads of the plains
 can sometimes be found in the cities, but often the halflings of the cities blend in with the rest of the
 population and display only the occasional reminder of their roots. Halflings are affiliated with the House
 Jorasco in Stormreach.;

RACENAME: Dwarf;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 +2 Constitution, -2 Charisma:}}
 Dwarves are stout and tough, but tend to be gruff and reserved.\par
{\b {\cf1 +2 bonus on Search checks:}}
 The Stonecunning ability gives a dwarf a sixth sense about stonework.\par
{\b {\cf1 +4 bonus on Balance checks:}}
 Dwarves are exceptionally stable on their feet.\par
{\b {\cf1 +2 saving throw bonus against poison:}}
 Dwarves are hardy and resistant to toxin.\par
{\b {\cf1 Dwarven Waraxes as Martial Weapons:}}
 Dwarves do not consider dwarven waraxes to be exotic weapons.\par\par
Dwarves are known for their skill in warfare, their ability to withstand physical and magical punishment,
 their knowledge of the earth's secrets, their hard work, and their capacity for drinking ale.\par\par
A dwarf adventurer may be motivated by crusading zeal, a love of excitement, or simple greed. As long as
 his accomplishments bring honor to his clan, his deeds earn him respect and status. Defeating giants and
 claiming powerful magic weapons are sure ways for a dwarf to earn the adulation of other dwarves.\par\par
The dwarven homeland in Eberron is the Mror Holds, a loose-knit federation of dwarf clans in the mountainous
 terrain in the east of Khorvaire. The dwarves have never had a unified empire and thus have never risen to
 the prominence of the elves or humans, though their control of mineral wealth has always made them important
 allies of the greater powers. Their mysterious kingdoms, carves out from the insides of mountains, are
 renowned for the marvelous treasures that they produce as gifts or for trade. Dwarves are affiliated with
 the House Kundarak in Stormreach.;

RACENAME: Warforged;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 +2 Constitution, -2 Wisdom, -2 Charisma:}}
 Warforged are resilient and powerful, but their difficulty in relating to other creatures makes them seem
 aloof or even hostile.\par
{\b {\cf1 Resistant to poison, sleep effects, paralysis, disease, nausea, fatigue, exhaustion:}}
 As living constructs, warforged have a natural resistance to the sickened condition.\par
{\b {\cf1 Stabilized by Repair skill, Repair Damage Spells regenerate, Cure Wounds Spells half as
 effective:}}
 Damage dealt to a warforged can be healed by a Repair Light Damage spell and warforged are stabilized
 by the Repair skill, however, Cure Light Wounds spells and potions only provide half their normal effect.\par
{\b {\cf1 +2 armor bonus and 5% chance arcane spell failure:}}
 The Composite Plating used to build a warforged takes the place of armor or robes and interferes slightly
 with spell casting.\par
{\b {\cf1 Light Fortification:}}
 There is a 25% chance that when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored, it is negated and damage is rolled
 normally.\par\par
Warforged are constructs built to fight in the Last War and the humanoid races of Eberron regard warforged as
 unpleasant reminders of the brutality of that war. As they strive to be a part of society, warforged struggle
 to find ways to relate to the other races that created them.\par\par
Adventuring is one way that warforged can fit into the world, at least as well as any adventurer ever does. In
 the wilds of Xen'drik, the ancient continent of secrets, few people care whether you were born or made, as long
 as you can help keep your companions alive. A fairly large number of warforged chose an adventuring life to
 escape from the confines of a society that they didn't create and at the same time engage in some meaningful
 activity\par\par
Originally intended as nothing more than mindless war machines, the warforged aquired sentience due to the arcane
 experiments intended to improve these weapons of destruction. Through these experiments, the warforged moved
 away from being true constructs and became alive. The basic and most plentiful warforged are just slightly larger
 than humans. Larger varieties of warforged-like constructs can also be encountered, as these remnants of the
 Last War still exist.;

RACENAME: Drow;
DESCRIPTION: {\b {\cf1 +2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma, -2 Constitution:}}
 Also known as Dark Elves, Drow are nimble, clever, and magnetic, but physically delicate.\par
 {\b {\cf1 Magical Defense:}} Drow are immune to magic sleep effects, and they gain a +2 saving throw
 bonus against Enchantment spells and an additional +2 Will save bonus against spells and spell-like
 effects. Finally, drow characters begin play with Spell Resistance 11, and this resistance can be
 increased as the drow gains levels.\par
 {\b {\cf1 +2 bonus on Listen, Search, and Spot Checks:}} a drow's senses are extremely sensitive.\par
 {\b {\cf1 Bonus weapon proficiency feats:}} Drow are proficient with the rapier, shortsword, and shuriken.\par\par
Most drow choose a life of adventure out of necessity, given the dangers of their homeland. Still, they
 greatly desire personal power, and many drow take up the mantle of adventurer seeking to satisfy their ambitions.
 Most drow follow the evil scorpion god Vulkoor, though exposure to the cultures of Stormreach has brought a few
 of them to less malevolent deities.\par\par
The elves of Eberron were born on the mysterious southern continent of Xen'drik, where they were
 slaves of the giant kingdoms. Tens of thousands of years ago, elf slaves rebelled against their masters.
 Unlike other elf races who fled the continent, the drow stayed behind on Xen'drik. Today most of the drow
 live within the ancient giant ruins hoping to take vengeance on their former masters and to learn the
 secrets of the giants' long-lost might. The drow believe that they alone preserve the dignity and valor
 of the elf race, dismissing the rebels who fled to Aerenal and their Valenar heirs.;
